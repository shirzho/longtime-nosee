# longtime-nosee
I created a web application called Long Time No See that allows you to connect one-on-one with friends, family members, and loved ones who you don’t have the chance to spend time with very often. The application acts as a space for users to generate and share ideas of things they want to do when they have an opportunity to see each other again. The idea is to have a place for two friends to hold things they look forward to doing together on a board and each board is made of posts of things to do. Some examples of posts could be Netflix shows to watch, restaurants to visit together, list of travel destinations etc. Other functionality includes a simple, one message at a time, no storage, live chat to facilitate communication in the application when both users are online and on each other’s board.

# Summary
built on Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Socket.IO
